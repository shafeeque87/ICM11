# Definition of the domain relations created during dbinit.
#
# Syntax: arbitrary_string=definition_name;domain1;domain2
#             ...
#
# Example: def1=SHIPPING_METHOD;Domain_A;Domain_B
#          def2=SHIPPING_METHOD;Domain_C;Domain_D
#          def3=SHIPPING_METHOD;Domain_A;Domain_D
#
# <B>Important note:</B> The cardinalities of the underlying relation definitions have
#                 a considerable effect. Just have a look at the above example.
#                 If the relation definition of 'SHIPPING_METHOD' was set to 1:1,
#                 def3 would lead to a cardinalities conflict with the relations created
#                 via def1 AND def2.
#                 If it was set to 1:n, only the relation created via def2 would lead to
#                 a conflict, because it's not possible for D to have
#                 multiple domain1s.
#                 Finally, if it was set to m:n, everything would be correct.
