#   With this file you control the creation of Addresses of Organizations and Departments when dbinit 
#   is called.
#
#   OrganizationID and optional DepartmentID specifies the AddressBook where the new address will be reside.
#   The Organization and Department have to be created before! If the property Address.x.IsDefault equals 
#   'true' the old (automatical generated) default address will be overwritten by this address.
#   Only one Defaultaddress for one Addressbook will be saved! The DepartmentID is used only for Enterprise and
#   Partner Organizations. If you provide no DepartmentID the address will be created in the own AddressBook of the
#   Organization. 
#   The DefaultAddress of an organization should be named with 'Contact Address' because it is used as Contact
#   Info of the Organization in the System Site (Operation Site).
#
