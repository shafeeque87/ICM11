RatingComment.2.Title = Nice headset for gamers
RatingComment.2.Comment = I bought this headset two weeks ago and I did not regret it. It's ultra comfortable and the sound is great. The length of the connecting cable is more than sufficient. The only downer is the high price.

RatingComment.4.Title = Great!
RatingComment.4.Comment = My new camera takes great pictures. I ordered it shortly before my 3 month trip through Australia and I never regretted it. The camera releases quickly, the images are sharp and the colors vibrant. 

RatingComment.5.Title = Perfect
RatingComment.5.Comment = I love this camera. I got it for my birthday and it takes the best pictures. 

RatingComment.6.Title = Robust and reliable
RatingComment.6.Comment = This camera accompanied me to 5 trips all around the world in the last years. Even humidity in the jungle and extreme heat in the desert didn't affect the camera at all. The casing is formed ergonomically so it's easy to shoot pictures, even while climbing a steep cliff. Reliable device for globetrotters.

RatingComment.7.Title = Perfect for families
RatingComment.7.Comment = My husband bought this camcorder to capture our daughter's first day at school. It has been used on all family events since, and the results are wonderful. 

RatingComment.8.Title = Pure adrenaline
RatingComment.8.Comment = I got this camera as a gift. It is one of the best devices I have ever owned! Out of the box I could start filming right away. No complex configuration or anything. Most of the time I used the helmet mount and took breathtaking videos while biking, motor cycling and (my absolute favorite) parachuting! The battery is quite powerful, so you can film the whole day long, without worrying. Absolutely great.

RatingComment.9.Title = Best gift ever
RatingComment.9.Comment = I gave this camera to my husband for his birthday and he was so happy. He started filming right away and the results are impressive. The price is quite high, but the amount of joy is priceless. 

RatingComment.10.Title = Handy device
RatingComment.10.Comment = We bought this remote control some weeks ago, finally banning 5 different remote controls from the coffee table. It's nice to have space for actual coffee now.

RatingComment.11.Title = Solid remote control
RatingComment.11.Comment = This remote control replaces the one from our TV, which was accidentally drowned in coffee. Of course we have to adapt a bit, but the buttons are clearly labeled and the casing seems solid.

RatingComment.33.Title = Absolutely recommended
RatingComment.33.Comment = I definitely recommend this head set. The audio quality is perfect, the noise reduction of the microphone is impressive. I use it on a regular basis to communicate with clients and I am very satisfied.

RatingComment.34.Title = Disappointment
RatingComment.34.Comment = I bought this headset after my old one finally died after 5 years of service. But I am deeply disappointed. What can I say? It works more or less. The casing and cable look tacky. The audio quality is medium. The microphone distorts my voice. All in all, don't buy this headset.

RatingComment.35.Title = A solid headset.
RatingComment.35.Comment = The sound quality is good, the microphone a bit weak. I recommend it, if you only use it occasionally.

RatingComment.36.Title = OK
RatingComment.36.Comment = For this price the headset is absolutely ok.

RatingComment.37.Title = Fair price
RatingComment.37.Comment = This headset's quality is surprisingly good for the moderate price. A good, honest product without any bells and whistles.

RatingComment.38.Title = Solid working device
RatingComment.38.Comment = I ordered this notebook some weeks ago for my home office and I am very pleased. The keyboard is ergonomic and the display has a high resolution. Paired with the excellent perfomance, I am much more effective in my work. 

RatingComment.39.Title = Powerful Notebook

RatingComment.42.Title = Not impressed
RatingComment.42.Comment = I got this as a present, and it was nice at first. But the selection of apps is limited and it often freezes. I think I will buy a new one soon.

RatingComment.43.Title = 2nd most important device on my desktop
RatingComment.43.Comment = I work with lots of people and collect data, images, spreadsheets from all kinds of sources. Of course, the most stuff comes by e-mail and cloud services, but still, several times a day I have to rely on my trusty card reader to pull the data to my computer. No rare kind of memory chip can surprise me.

RatingComment.44.Title = Very handy
RatingComment.44.Comment = I travel a lot and I usually carry an external hard drive with me. This sleek hard drive sleeve always protects my hard drive. 

RatingComment.45.Title = Cheap zipper

RatingComment.46.Title = OK
RatingComment.46.Comment = This was a present. Since I don't use external hard drives any more, I use it for all the headphone cables, USB sticks, SD cards and other stuff that usually populate the corners of my back pack. It's quite handy for this purpose

RatingComment.47.Comment = We bought this printer together with our new digital camera. The prints are beautiful and crisp. The whole family loves our family portraits.

RatingComment.48.Title = Good images
RatingComment.48.Comment = This printer was on sale when we bought it, so we just gave it a try. And yes, the printer delivers good images for its price. But we will still stick to getting professionally developped prints from the photographer for images of important life events.

RatingComment.49.Title = Useful Device

RatingComment.122.Title = Amazing device, not quite as advertised
RatingComment.122.Comment = Overall, the Surface Book 2 15" is one of the single best PCs I've even researched, much less owned. It is a pleasure to use, and there was obviously great care in it's design. For being a premium level device however, there are some definite drawbacks. First, whoever decided that there is $400 in value for no change to the device other than an increase of 256 GB to the internal storage needs to reassess that. For us customers, go spend half that on an external SSD (which will be limited by the fact that the USB-C port is not Thunderbolt 3, and no one seems to know if it is gen 1 or gen 2 speeds) and call that good. Second, the device actually draws more power than the charger provides. Isn't addressing that sort of issue covered in first level computer design courses? Microsoft seems well aware of this, and rather then letting the device die they throttle it under sustained load. To Microsoft, either don't market the device as a workstation or get it in line with what you say it does.

RatingComment.123.Title = Not too thrilled...
RatingComment.123.Comment = If they included a power charger capable of handling what this system is capable of, my review would be much different.. I love the system... Everything runs smoothly on it and looks beautiful.. But what's the point if the charger can't keep up with it?? I've read the articles that this was by design. and if that's the case, I really can't recommend this.. As an example.. Just now, I tried playing a simulator game on Steam.. nothing crazy in the graphics department.. I'm set to Power mode... Batteries were at 100% , Charger plugged in. and maybe 30 minutes in, the game shuts down because one of the batteries has reached 0% Seriously? There should be no drain I've also noticed some slight drain even without gaming.. It's a shame because the system runs very fast and I love the design.. but the decision to include a charger incapable of handing what the system can do, just makes no sense to me.. and as of right now, I don't see any other options as far as chargers go...

RatingComment.124.Title = Wonderful in many way, still lacking in a couple
RatingComment.124.Comment = This is my 2nd surface book (bought the performance base last year). the 15" really has upped the bar on graphic performance, and loving the additional screen real estate. For me, it's the versatility of configurations that really sets this device apart from all others. I also really like that it doesn't seem to get as hot as the Surfacebook w/ performance base did. The down sides: It's a shame they STILL haven't added a micro sim for better mobility connectivity options. Great bump in expansions by adding the USB C, but really, why just USB C and not full on Thunderbolt 3??? Seems like they fell short of the jump they could have made. Last, if they are going to keep annual or bi-annual releases, they really need to come up with a back-up utility that both works, and allows all licensing and programs to be transferred to newer devices more seamlessly. What a royal pain to get all of the office/Project/Visio programs re-installed and licenses transferred.

RatingComment.125.Title = Exceptional
RatingComment.125.Comment = Surface Book 2 - 15"/i7/512/16 I'm amazed by this device, clearly a step up from the previous generation. The screen layout is exceptional for coding and it has no trouble driving my dual Samsung CF791 (C34F791) displays in a (3) 4k monitor configuration (2 CF's on dock + surface display). I wish the keys had a little more weight and I would have liked to see TB3 on it, but surface dock + USB-C handles everything I do exceptionally well (and tbh ... my TB3 docks have given me headaches over the past year). Nothing to make me want to drop the *'s from a 5. Note to Microsoft ... you should give people the option of paying for things like 32GB of ram ... it was my only hesitation in the whole process ;) Tablet is very light, track pad is great and the machine is extremely fast - I've observed marked reduction in compiler time. I've also noticed a marked reduction in the chassis edges pushing on my forearms. Looking forward to the next few years with Surface Book 2 :)

RatingComment.126.Title = Broken Hearted
RatingComment.126.Comment = I had been saving my money for this dream machine over half a year. I had been using a MacBook pro for 4 years and not once I had felt switching, till they launched the 15 inch version. And finally I was able to buy it. What a device, what a minimal beauty, I was astonished since the time I opened the package and turned it on. I am a designer and this machine is made for people like us. I also bought the much necessary pen and the dial and eventually the precision mouse. What a beautiful portable workstation. I was literally paperless after trying to do that for almost a half a decade now. But then one fine day I opened the laptop and found that the screen had a crack. The most troubling part was last night I just closed the lid and slept. There was no fall, no physical damage or anything else, absolutely nothing. I was baffled. How can this happen and I don't know who or what to blame. My MacBook has survived worst falls and it still is intact. I am disappointed and broken hearted.

RatingComment.133.Title = Great light but requires the rest of the kit.
RatingComment.133.Comment = Good little bulb, not as bright as standard LED bulbs but the hue function is useful. I have this and a Hue starter set with hub, coupled with a number of bulbs, hue motion sensor, amazon dot and a google home device. Anyone looking to add automated lighting to their homes, this is easy to set up, can be controlled by mobile app from hue or via a connected device like the amazon dot. Lights can be configured into groups such as living room, bedroom and kitchen so easy to manage. One slight problem at the moment with the solution when used with the amazon dot is that you can't say "turn on the lights" and it detect the room based on the dots location, you always have to specify the group you want. This is an important step thats unfortunately been missed out however this is more of a problem with the dot (which i'm sure will be resolved in time).

RatingComment.135.Title = Exceeds expectations!
RatingComment.135.Comment = I've had the Surface 3 for several years, and the fabric still looks brand new, so I don't expect this laptop's keyboard to be any different. It's great to not have to rest your hands on freezing metal. It has amazing battery life, and a very high-quality keyboard material. What's even more surprising is how stunning it looks, and it certainly turns heads! I have the cobalt blue, and I can say that it is gorgeous and adds to the high quality experience. In low lit areas, it can seem like a dark grey or black which (personally) I love! It's great to have more unique colors offered for laptops. For those worried about Windows 10 S and the restrictions that come with it, a simple click of a button upgrades you to Windows Pro without any fee and allows you unrestricted access to the things you want to download. I can easily say that choosing this over an apple product was the right decision, especially if you like Windows, a touch screen, and want to be unique. Amazing work!

RatingComment.136.Comment = I received my Surface Laptop two days ago - earlier that the June 15th ship date, which is nice. I immediately switched from Windows 10s to Windows 10 PRO, as I had some software I need to run which isn't available on the Microsoft Store. Everybody is talking about the lack of USB-C, and I agree... this was a mistake for Microsoft to not standardize on this. But it's the right size and price, and I've enjoyed using touch screen on my Surface Pro 3, so I went for it. The screen is brilliant and crisp, and the 2:3 aspect ratio looks great when browsing. The keyboard is much more solid than my Surface 3, and the Alcantara feels nice. My only disappointment was with the keyboard backlighting, which is very uneven and "cheap" looking. The "7/&" key is about 5x brighter that adjacent keys, and the whole thing looks spotty. But the keys feel nice and reassuring. Trackpad works well too.

RatingComment.137.Title = Most versatile device on the market
RatingComment.137.Comment = I work in IT and I travel in and out of businesses all day long. I need a complete operating system in order to connect to business domains, have the ability to use Remote Desktop services, and I need something light and portable with a good battery life. This device definitely does all of those things. I've only had it for one day but I love my new surface pro. It's extremely fast, quiet, light, portable, and the battery lasts a super long time. I am looking forward to LTE support however. I heard that this will be available in a later update. So far I've installed office 365 using outlook word excel etc... I remoted into several PCs using remote software, I use outlook and Citrix all day and the surface pro has performed all of these tasks with ease. I was a little bit worried about the fanless cooling system but mine has remained cool the entire time and has never felt hot at all. I'm extremely pleased and look forward to what my surface pro helps me accomplish. Thanks.

RatingComment.138.Title = Good and Bad
RatingComment.138.Comment = Great computer, not so great support. Love the computer. However mine developed a weird crack on the screen. It has never been dropped or mistreated in any way and the crack shows that, it is a single crack and curves around the screen. Never seen a device mistreated that cracked like this, the only thing I can think of is the slight pressure on a corner while taking my cover off, but even then I would think the crack would be more than a single curved crack. I took it to a store to see if anything can be done and while I tried to argue a defect they said there is nothing they can do, I can pay them $450 for a new screen was the only option. My advice is get the extra warranty, if the screen breaks for any reason its your problem even if it was not accidental damage, MS doesn't care, buy a new product is their belief, which is the wrong attitude to take when other manufacturer's have developed comparable products.

RatingComment.141.Title = Hands-on with the giant, expensive collaboration screen
RatingComment.141.Comment = Every creative studio is going to want a Microsoft Surface Hub, but few will be able to justify the cost. It's a digital-whiteboard-meets-conferencing-system that both impresses and has practical benefits for creatives – whether you work for a branding or digital agency, or a visual effects or video post house. But it's also £21,000. I got to try out the Surface Hub at Microsoft's London HQ. It's been on sale in a limited fashion for about a year, mainly to very large businesses – but now Microsoft has opened up the number of resellers, so it's only now that its available to a wider range of agencies (who can afford it). The purpose of the Surface Hub is to be a large screen that sits in your biggest meeting room. During internal or client meetings, you can create and annotate materials related to a project – sketching ideas or wireframes; adding notes to photos, screengrabs or other images; building moodboards or otherwise sorting research materials, and a whole bunch more. Developers can build industry-specific applications – such as tools for marking up 4K video.

RatingComment.142.Title = Amazing device, not quite as advertised
RatingComment.142.Comment = Overall, the Surface Book 2 15" is one of the single best PCs I've even researched, much less owned. It is a pleasure to use, and there was obviously great care in it's design. For being a premium level device however, there are some definite drawbacks. First, whoever decided that there is $400 in value for no change to the device other than an increase of 256 GB to the internal storage needs to reassess that. For us customers, go spend half that on an external SSD (which will be limited by the fact that the USB-C port is not Thunderbolt 3, and no one seems to know if it is gen 1 or gen 2 speeds) and call that good. Second, the device actually draws more power than the charger provides. Isn't addressing that sort of issue covered in first level computer design courses? Microsoft seems well aware of this, and rather then letting the device die they throttle it under sustained load. To Microsoft, either don't market the device as a workstation or get it in line with what you say it does.

RatingComment.143.Title = Not too thrilled...
RatingComment.143.Comment = If they included a power charger capable of handling what this system is capable of, my review would be much different.. I love the system... Everything runs smoothly on it and looks beautiful.. But what's the point if the charger can't keep up with it?? I've read the articles that this was by design. and if that's the case, I really can't recommend this.. As an example.. Just now, I tried playing a simulator game on Steam.. nothing crazy in the graphics department.. I'm set to Power mode... Batteries were at 100% , Charger plugged in. and maybe 30 minutes in, the game shuts down because one of the batteries has reached 0% Seriously? There should be no drain I've also noticed some slight drain even without gaming.. It's a shame because the system runs very fast and I love the design.. but the decision to include a charger incapable of handing what the system can do, just makes no sense to me.. and as of right now, I don't see any other options as far as chargers go...

RatingComment.144.Title = Wonderful in many way, still lacking in a couple
RatingComment.144.Comment = This is my 2nd surface book (bought the performance base last year). the 15" really has upped the bar on graphic performance, and loving the additional screen real estate. For me, it's the versatility of configurations that really sets this device apart from all others. I also really like that it doesn't seem to get as hot as the Surfacebook w/ performance base did. The down sides: It's a shame they STILL haven't added a micro sim for better mobility connectivity options. Great bump in expansions by adding the USB C, but really, why just USB C and not full on Thunderbolt 3??? Seems like they fell short of the jump they could have made. Last, if they are going to keep annual or bi-annual releases, they really need to come up with a back-up utility that both works, and allows all licensing and programs to be transferred to newer devices more seamlessly. What a royal pain to get all of the office/Project/Visio programs re-installed and licenses transferred.

RatingComment.145.Title = Exceptional
RatingComment.145.Comment = Surface Book 2 - 15"/i7/512/16 I'm amazed by this device, clearly a step up from the previous generation. The screen layout is exceptional for coding and it has no trouble driving my dual Samsung CF791 (C34F791) displays in a (3) 4k monitor configuration (2 CF's on dock + surface display). I wish the keys had a little more weight and I would have liked to see TB3 on it, but surface dock + USB-C handles everything I do exceptionally well (and tbh ... my TB3 docks have given me headaches over the past year). Nothing to make me want to drop the *'s from a 5. Note to Microsoft ... you should give people the option of paying for things like 32GB of ram ... it was my only hesitation in the whole process ;) Tablet is very light, track pad is great and the machine is extremely fast - I've observed marked reduction in compiler time. I've also noticed a marked reduction in the chassis edges pushing on my forearms. Looking forward to the next few years with Surface Book 2 :)
